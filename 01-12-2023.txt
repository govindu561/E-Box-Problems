Prblem-6:
Develop a program to find simple interest and compund interest for a given principal amount, rate and tenure.

Simple interest is interest paid only on the original principal, not on the interest accrued. Simple interest is determined by multiplying the interest rate by the principal by the number of periods.

When the interest rate is applied to the original principal and any accumulated interest, this is called compound interest.

First line of input corresponds to principal

Second line of input corresponds to rate of interest

Third line of input corresponds to time

11
12715

Sample Output 1:
1000

Explanation:

By the formula of SI, the person will get Rs.0715y as simple interest. He also deposits Rs.y for 12 months, so totally he deposits Rs.12.715y ((y*12)+0.715y).

By having the total amount Arun will get at the time of maturity is Rs. 12715 and the maturity value Rs.12.715y, we can find how much did he deposited every month 

y = 12715/12.715 = 1000
 
Problem-10:

36
1500
30

Sample Output 1:

B
953
 

Explanation:

By the formula, Person A will get Rs.6660 as simple interest. He also deposits Rs.1200 for 36 months, so totally he deposits Rs.43200 (1200*36). 

The total amount Person A will get at the time of maturity is Rs. 49860 (43200+6660)

By the formula, Person B will get Rs.5812.5 as simple interest. He also deposits Rs.1500 for 30 months, so totally he deposits Rs.45000 (1500*30). 

The total amount Person A will get at the time of maturity is Rs. 50813 (45000+5812.5)

So, Person B will get more money than A by Rs.953 (50813−49860)
