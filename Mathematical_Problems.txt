Problem-1:

Given a number 'n', write a program to find the numbers (less than or equal to n) which are both Fibonacci and Prime.

Input format:

Input consists of an integer 'n'.

Output format:
Output consists of an integer series separated by a space which are both fibonacci and prime.
Find the fibonacci series upto n and display the prime numbers from the fibonacci series.

Sample Input 1:
40
Sample Output 1:
2 3 5 13
Sample Input 2:
1
Sample Output 2:
No prime numbers in the fibonacci series

problem-2:

There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.
Consider the above diagram with n value 3. From that, we can notice that there are 3 ways to reach top.
Input format:
Input contains a single integer n.

Output format:
Output consists of an integer corresponds to the number of ways to reach the top.
Sample Input 1:
1
Sample Output 1:
1                                    // There is only one way to climb 1 stair
Sample Input 2:
2                                 
Sample Output 2:
2                                  // There are two ways: (1, 1) and (2)
Sample Input 3:
4
Sample Output 3:
5                                 // There are five ways: (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1), (2, 2)

Problem-3:
Given an array of numbers, write a program to find GCD of the array elements

Input format:
First line of input consists of an integer n, corresponds to the size of array.

The next n lines of input corresponds to the elements in an array.
Output format:
Output consists of an integer which corresponds to the GCD of the array elements.
Sample Input:
3

2
4
6
Sample Output:
2

Proble-4:
Given an array of n numbers, write a program to find LCM of array elements.

Input format:

First line of input consists of an integer n, corresponds to the size of array.

The next n lines of input corresponds to the elements in an array.

 Output format:

Output consists of an integer which corresponds to the LCM of the array elements.

Sample Input:

4

2

1

8

3

Sample Output:

24

Problem-5:

Given a positive integer n, write a program to find the largest prime factor of a number.

Input format:

Input consists of an integer number n. Assume that the n value ranges ( 1 <= n <= 1015).

Output format:

Output contains an integer, which corresponds to the largest prime factor of a given number n.

Sample Input:

6

Sample Output:

3
